# Just Another Pascal Compiler
Welcome to JAPC internals documentation.
## Introduction
This is intended to be a complete description (at least I'm trying to) on how internally the JAPC compiler works and how is it 
implemented. These are not instructions on how to use JAPC and this one does not contain ANY user manual related information.
You can find all of this information in user manual.

## Caveat
This documentation is auto-generated with doxygen, which means may not be fully updated. I will try to keep it as updated as
I can. :)
